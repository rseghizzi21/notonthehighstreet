This project is a stand alone java project.
For project build and dependencies management its uses Gradle tool.(doesn't do to much)
I used a do small and test approach. So a test for the most critical classes was made. 
For time restrictions, I have to use the approach to solve quickly the problem. More that in the code.
The project entry point is MarketPlace class.
The pakage com.onlinemarketplace.data , deal with data definition e data loading.
The pakage com.onlinemarketplace.businesslogic are the core service logic classes.
